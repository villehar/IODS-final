# IODS-final

This repository is for my final assignment of the IODS course. 

The assignment has been submitted in a form of htlm document that shows data and analyses of an experimental social psychological study recarding social computer mediated decision-making between non-human virtual agents and human subjects.

My research question was whether people accept agents' monetary offers more likely if being touched by the avatar before receiving the offer and whether the effect of agent's touch depends on the accompanied facial expressions of the agent. Since the outcome was binary (accept or reject) and the offers were repeated hundreds of times within each participant, a normal logistic regression was not appropriate. Consecuently, I run the analyses both with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to see whether the assumption of independent observations inherited in logistic regression biases the results.
